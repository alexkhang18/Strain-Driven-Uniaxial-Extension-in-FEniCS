# Strain-Driven-Uniaxial-Extension-in-FEniCS

This is a minimum working example of how to implement a strain driven uniaxial extension of a Neo-Hookean bar in the open-source software FEniCS. Users will have to have FEniCS downloaded and installed (https://fenicsproject.org/download/). The script outputs displacement mapped onto the geometry as a .pvd file which can be viewed in the open source software Paraview (https://www.paraview.org/).
